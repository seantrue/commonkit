"""Two-tier pixel cache: an in-process memo over the shared store.

Why two tiers and not a straight replacement, in one measurement:

The consumer's face-crop path calls its pixel accessor **twice per face**
-- once for the base dimensions, once for the crop. An 18-face page is
therefore 36 lookups. Today that is one 38 ms decode plus 35 free in-process
hits. Against a shared store alone it would be 36 attaches at ~3.3 ms each =
119 ms, **three times slower than doing nothing at all**. Attaching is cheap, but
it is not free, and a loop that attaches per crop is the one access pattern that
turns a cache into a pessimization.

So L1 memoises the ATTACHED MAPPING, not a second copy of the pixels. The first
lookup attaches; every later lookup in that process is a dict hit. The pixels
still live once in shared memory and are still shared across processes -- L1 adds
no bytes, it removes syscalls.

Tier order: L1 in-process memo -> L2 shared store -> decode.

        The return channel this class used to lack, and the lack of which was a
        real defect rather than an inelegance. ``entry.decoded`` could not ask
        what happened, so it inferred it from counter DELTAS -- reading
        ``shm_hit`` off this object, which deliberately does not tick it because
        the store already does. The inference silently defaulted to "decode",
        so every cross-process attach was reported as a decode.

        Answering directly deletes the inference instead of correcting it. It is
        also the only thread-safe shape: this cache is a module-global shared
        across a node's CONCURRENCY threads, so recording "what I did last" on
