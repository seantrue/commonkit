"""Named shared-memory segments for numpy arrays.

The name is for Fortran's ``COMMON`` block: a named region several separately
compiled programs agree to share. The name is the whole interface, and the
segment outlives whoever wrote it.

``store`` is the mechanism and carries the measured reasons behind it, ``keys``
the addressing, ``cache`` the in-process memo that keeps a tight loop from
paying an attach per call.
