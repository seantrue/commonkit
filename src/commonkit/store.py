"""A digest-keyed store of DECODED arrays, shared across processes.

Extracted from the pixel-cache layer of a private image-corpus
application, where it ran in production first; the measurements below were
taken there. Nothing but numpy, because the python-3.11 model venvs that
consume it cannot import anything heavier.

Why named ``.npy`` files rather than anything cleverer, all measured on a
Linux host (x86-64, a ZFS pool plus tmpfs ``/dev/shm``) on 2026-09-10:

* A named segment **persists with zero attachers**, so it survives a queue hop --
  a record can sit in RabbitMQ for minutes and a later consumer still attaches.
  An anonymous ``memfd`` is freed when the last fd closes, which disqualifies
  fd-passing however attractive its sealing story is.
* **Unlink while mapped is safe**: the name disappears, live mappings keep
  reading, the kernel reclaims on last unmap. So the reaper never has to know who
  is attached, and no cross-process refcounting is needed anywhere.
* ``np.load(mmap_mode="r")`` returns ``writeable=False`` and re-enabling it is
  REFUSED by numpy. Read-only is enforced rather than advisory, for free.
* ``.npy`` is exactly the (shape, dtype, data) triple, with a 128-byte header and
  the payload 64-byte aligned for mmap. ``np.save`` costs 0.93 ms against 0.89 ms
  for a bare buffer write, so the container is free.
* ``multiprocessing.shared_memory`` is unusable here: its resource tracker
  deletes segments when the first unrelated process exits, and ``track=False``
  needs python 3.13 while every model venv is 3.11.

Running this on macOS is a different trade -- no /dev/shm, no Pss to measure
sharing with, and unified memory in which a RAM disk competes directly with
on-device model weights. Measure before enabling it there: on Apple Silicon the
internal SSD beat a RAM disk (first attach 0.69 ms against 0.76 ms), and a
``ram://`` disk commits its whole size up front as dirty memory.

THE INVARIANT THIS WHOLE DESIGN RESTS ON: *a missing segment is never an error,
only a slower path.* Every miss -- reaped, declined, torn, absent root -- returns
None and the caller re-decodes in 38 ms. Nothing here may raise into a caller.
