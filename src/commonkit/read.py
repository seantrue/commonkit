"""Counting what a lookup did, in ONE vocabulary.

A store answers three ways and the names for them are worth owning centrally,
because the alternative is what happened before this module existed: two paths
to the same pixels each decided independently what to call a hit, wrote the
SAME counter names for DIFFERENT events, and nothing downstream could tell
which one it was reading. One of them classified by counter DELTA and was
wrong for two days; a correct production measurement was retracted on the
strength of the ambiguity.

The counter PREFIX is the caller's, not ours: ``pixels_shm`` and ``audio_shm``
are different measurements and must not collide in one stats table.
