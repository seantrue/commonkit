"""Addressing: the key for a segment, and the path that key names.

Key shape::

    {domain}:{version}:{form}:{digest}:{variant}

Path shape::

    {root}/{form}/{digest[:2]}/{digest}.{variant}.npy

Two-level sharding like a CAS, so no directory ever holds a million entries.

A :class:`KeyScheme` fixes one domain's vocabulary. The pieces mean:

``domain``
    Who the segments belong to -- ``pixels``, ``audio``. Also the dispatch key:
    schemes register themselves, so :func:`parse` and :func:`relpath` can work
    from a key alone and one store can hold several domains.
``version``
    The DECODE CONTRACT, not a release number. Bump it when what a segment
    contains changes meaning, so old segments become unreachable rather than
    being attached by a reader that assumes the new contract. (``pixels`` is at
    ``v3`` because ``v2`` segments could hold LA/RGBA, which ``v3`` readers
    assume away.)
``form``
    What KIND of array -- ``pil`` uint8 images, ``f32chw`` model tensors,
    ``wav16k`` int16 audio. Deliberately NOT colour order: a BGR view is
    converted from the one stored RGB segment in about a millisecond against a
    38 ms decode, and storing both would double the tree to save that
    millisecond while letting the two drift.
``variant``
    What distinguishes two renderings of the SAME source bytes. This is the
    axis that differs per domain and the reason the scheme is a class rather
    than a constant: images vary by orientation (``o0`` raw, ``o1`` oriented,
    ``oa`` Apple), a waveform would vary by sample rate (``sr16000``).

The form segment precedes the digest so that a domain whose variant suffix is
already load-bearing elsewhere keeps it at the end of the key, untouched.
